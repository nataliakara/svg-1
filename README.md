## Drawing on the Web SVG projects 
### Spring 2016 
----------------

I forked Erica's SVG project using GitHub.

Her icon was an image of herself with the initials of her blog.

I used illustrator and decided to change it up by adding more colors, dimensions,text.
I wanted to make it more vague and less personal so I removed the name " Erica" and added a "?" in its place. I also removed her face in order to represent the broader audience of my svg.
